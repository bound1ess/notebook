# Self-study guide

1. Portfolio (perhaps open source projects)
2. Technical communication
  - English, the one and only language of CS folks
  - master a presentation tool (probably even HTML5-based one)
  - LaTeX
  - oral presentations, speaking
3. Mathematics
  - discrete Math
  - probability and statistics
  - some calculus
  - linear algebra, something else to throw in?
4. Unix systems
5. Systems administration, pure basics:
  - install and maintain a Linux distrib.
  - configure and compile the Linux kernel
  - troubleshoot a connection with dig, ping and traceroute
  - compile and configure a webserver
  - compile and configure a DNS daemon
  - maintain a website
6. Programming languages
  - write your own compiler/interpreter
  - different paradigms, like OOP, functional, imperative programming
  - C++ is a must, probably some Assembly language
7. Data structures and algorithms
  - different algorithm design approaches
  - imperative/functional versions
8. Theory
  - models of computation and computational complexity
9. Architecture
  - understand a computer from the transistors up
10. Operating systems
  - system calls, paging, scheduling, context-switching
  - filesystems and internal resource management
11. Networking
  - building transmission protocols (protocol design)
  - building an HTTP client and daemon
  - building a DNS resolver and server
  - building a CLI SMTP mailer
12. Security
  - social engineering, buffer overflows, integer overflow, code injection vulnerabilities
  - race conditions, privilege confusion
  - picking a good password, proper iptable usage
  - Web applications security
13. Cryptography
  - know how to salt and hash passwords for storage
  - symmetric-key cryptosystems, public-key cryptosystems, secure hash functions
  - challenge-response authentication, digital signature algorithms, threshold cryptosystems
  - RSA implementation
  - writing a console Web client that connects over SSL
  - creating your own digital certificate, setting up HTTPS
  - using GPG, public-key authentication for SSH
  - encrypting files, directories and hard disks
14. Software testing
15. User experience design
  - writing usable interfaces in CSS, HTML, JavaScript
16. Visualization
17. Parallelism
  - threads, CUDA, OpenCL, MPI?
18. Software engineering
  - understanding of VCSs like Git
  - tools like GDB, Valgrind
19. Formal methods
