# Designing algorithms

```
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.
```

```
A paradigm is a very high level algorithm for solving a class of problems.

## Brute force approach/paradigm

Want to find a solution? Try all possible ones!

Pros:
- easy and straightforward

Cons:
- usually very expensive (in terms of time complexity)

Examples:
- [linear (sequential) search](code/linear-search.cpp)
- [2-sum problem](code/2-sum.cpp)
- [factors of a given number](code/number-factors.cpp)
