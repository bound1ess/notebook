```

```
A paradigm is a very high level algorithm for solving a class of problems.

## Brute force approach/paradigm

Want to find a solution? Try all possible ones!

- \+ easy and straightforward
- \- usually very expensive (in terms of time complexity)

Examples: linear (sequential) search, 2-sum problem, factors of a given number.
